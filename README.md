## Tasks üìù
### LAB1: Solving problems by searching
- **Assignment:** Build a CLI, which finds the most convenient (by time, distance or bus change count) public transport connections in Wroc≈Çaw between two user given points. The app should also find the most optimal paths containing multiple user defined intermediate destinations.
- **Subdirectory:** `path-finding`
- **Covered algorithms:**
  - [Depth-First Search (DFS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search)
  - [Breadth-First Search (BFS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)
  - [Dijkstra's Algorithm / Uniform Cost Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)
  - [A* Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) (with various heuristics and optimizations)
  - [Tabu Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabu_search) (with modifications)
- **Key features:**
  - Parsing and building a giant digraph from a `.csv` edge file.
    - Automatic transformation from a [time-dependent graph](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41019-019-00105-0) to a static graph.
    - Time- and memory-efficient node representation.
      - Use of stack-allocated [`smol_str`](https://github.com/rust-analyzer/smol_str) for strings smaller than 24 bytes.
      - Custom-built [string interning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_interning) solution for stop names.
      - Public interface and architecture based on numeric node identifiers.
    - Custom transformation from [WGS-84](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System#WGS84) to a local kilometer-based coordinate system.
      - Memory footprint of a single position down from 24 to 8 bytes.
      - Less than 2 centimeters of error in comparison with real-life distance results.
      - Major speed up for any future distance calculations (the transformation makes [haversine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula) redundant).
      - Researched and built together with [@jakubzehner](https://github.com/jakubzehner).
    - Index-based [adjacency list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_list) representation with $O(1)$ stop name lookups using hash tables.
  - Separation of bus stops with same names but different locations.
    - Ability to walk between different stops of the same name with a small time penalty.
    - Waiting the night if all buses for a given day already left.
  - Path finding using A* and Dijkstra with various optimization criteria.
  - Ability to fine-tune heuristics for better computation time or accuracy (with option to use [non-admissible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admissible_heuristic) heuristics).
  - Path finding with intermediate destinations using a hybrid of Tabu Search and A* ([travelling salesman problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem)).
  - A total of 1.5k lines of Rust source code.
  - Covered by around 20 unit tests checking all of the core app logic.

### LAB2: Adversarial search and games
- **Assignment:** Create a terminal implementation of the game of [Reversi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi) (AKA Othello). You should be able to play against a computer using various Minimax strategies. You should be able to run two instances of the program and make them play against each other.
- **Subdirectory:** `game-theory`
- **Covered algorithms:**
  - [Minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax)
  - [Alpha-Beta Pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning)
  - [Flood Fill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_fill) ([Dumb7Fill](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Dumb7Fill))
  - [Genetic Algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm)
  - [Monte Carlo Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method)
  - [Bidirectional Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidirectional_search)
- **Key features:**
  - Fully rulebook compliant and blazingly fast Reversi logic implementation extended to support different game variants.
    - Based on optimized [sliding piece attack](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Sliding_Piece_Attacks) chess algorithms.
    - Memory efficient [bitboard](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Bitboards) game state representation.
    - Custom move generation algorithm, which is over 25 times faster than naive implementation.
    - Invalid game states made unrepresentable.
    - Game state reachability checks based on piece stability inspired by [Rosenbloom 1982](https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:wk764yw7162/wk764yw7162.pdf).
  - Player AI using the Minimax algorithm optimized with alpha-beta pruning.
    - Almost 20 available heuristics, including well known trained basic heuristic combinations.
    - Five heuristics trained using genetic algorithms, monte carlo methods and the [Elo rating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system).
    - Other, naive strategies also available.
  - Colored game board view based on [ANSI escape codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code).
  - Over 2.5k lines of Rust source code.
  - Logic covered with over 80 tests.
    - Unit tests covering basic game logic.
    - End-to-end tests checking the implementation against real world tournament games.
    - [Property testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing#Property_testing) of complicated game logic invariants.

### Notes
The course included a fifth assignment covering **neural networks**, however this exercise was done during the lab and is too insignificant to include here. The goal was to train a [multilayer perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron) to rate jokes from the [Jester dataset](https://eigentaste.berkeley.edu/dataset/) using [BERT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_(language_model)) word embeddings.

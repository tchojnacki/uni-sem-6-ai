## Tasks üìù
### LAB1: Solving problems by searching
- **Assignment:** Build a CLI, which finds the most convenient (by time, distance or bus change count) public transport connections in Wroc≈Çaw between two user given points. The app should also find the most optimal paths containing multiple user defined intermediate destinations.
- **Subdirectory:** `path-finding`
- **Covered algorithms:**
  - [Depth-First Search (DFS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search)
  - [Breadth-First Search (BFS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)
  - [Dijkstra's Algorithm / Uniform Cost Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)
  - [A* Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) (with various heuristics and optimizations)
  - [Tabu Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabu_search)
- **Key features:**
  - Parsing and building a giant digraph from a `.csv` edge file.
    - Automatic transformation from a [time-dependent graph](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41019-019-00105-0) to a static graph.
    - Time- and memory-efficient node representation.
      - Use of stack-allocated [`smol_str`](https://github.com/rust-analyzer/smol_str) for strings smaller than 24 bytes.
      - Custom-built [string interning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_interning) solution for stop names.
      - Public interface and architecture based on numeric node identifiers.
    - Custom transformation from [WGS-84](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System#WGS84) to a local kilometer-based coordinate system.
      - Memory footprint of a single position down from 24 to 8 bytes.
      - Less than 2 centimeters of error in comparison with real-life distance results.
      - Major speed up for any future distance calculations (the transformation makes [haversine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula) redundant).
      - Researched and built together with [@jakubzehner](https://github.com/jakubzehner).
    - Index-based [adjacency list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_list) representation with $O(1)$ stop name lookups using hash tables.
  - Separation of bus stops with same names but different locations.
    - Ability to walk between different stops of the same name with a small time penalty.
    - Waiting the night if all buses for a given day already left.
  - Path finding using A* and Dijkstra with various optimization criteria.
  - Ability to fine-tune heuristics for better computation time or accuracy (with option to use [non-admissible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admissible_heuristic) heuristics).
  - Path finding with intermediate destinations using a hybrid of Tabu Search and A* ([travelling salesman problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem)).
  - A total of 1.5k lines of Rust source code.
  - Covered by around 20 unit tests checking all of the core app logic.
